# patterns-dev-journal
This repository documents my 30-day learning journey through [Patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev), exploring **design patterns**, **rendering patterns**, and **performance patterns** for building modern web applications.

---

## ðŸ“… Learning Plan
Iâ€™m following a structured 30-day plan to cover one pattern per day, documenting:
- A brief explanation of the pattern
- Problems it solves
- How it works
- A real-world mapping
- My own mini-implementation

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Structure
- `Pattern-Journal.md` â€” Main daily log of notes  
- `implementations/dayXX` â€” Code examples for each pattern  
- `assets/images` â€” Screenshots or diagrams used in notes  

---

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Strengthen my understanding of application architecture.
- Practice explaining concepts in my own words.
- Build a reference library for future projects.

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack for Implementations
- Vanilla JavaScript
- React
- Node.js
- Any other tech that suits the pattern being studied.
